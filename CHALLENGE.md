**Kubernetes Microservice Challenge**

**Overview**

This challenge is designed to evaluate your backend development skills, including API design, containerization, and deployment using Kubernetes. You’ll build a simple microservice in Go, deploy it in a containerized environment, and demonstrate its functionality through a live demo or screencast.

---

**Requirements**

You are expected to:

- Develop a RESTful API in **Go**.
- Containerize the application using **Docker**.
- Deploy the service to a **Kubernetes** cluster (local or cloud).
- Implement health checks and configuration management.
- Optionally persist data using an embedded store.
- Document your approach and provide a visual demonstration.

---

**Task Description**

**1. Microservice Functionality**

Build a **ToDo** microservice with the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| GET | `/todos` | Retrieve all ToDo items |
| POST | `/todos` | Create a new ToDo item |
| PUT | `/todos/{id}` | Update an existing ToDo item |
| DELETE | `/todos/{id}` | Delete a ToDo item |

Each ToDo item should include:

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `title`: String
- `completed`: Boolean

You may use in-memory storage or a lightweight embedded database (e.g., **BoltDB**) for persistence.

---

**2. Dockerization**

Create a `Dockerfile` that:

- Uses an official Go base image.
- Implements a **multi-stage build** to optimize image size.
- Exposes port **8080**.
- Includes instructions to build and run the service.

---

**3. Kubernetes Deployment**

Provide Kubernetes manifests for:

- **Deployment**:
    - 2 replicas
    - Resource limits (CPU/memory)
- **Service**:
    - Type: ClusterIP or LoadBalancer
- **ConfigMap**:
    - For environment variables (e.g., default port)
- **Health Probes**:
    - Readiness and Liveness checks

Optional:

- **PersistentVolumeClaim** for data persistence if using BoltDB or similar.

---

**4. Configuration & Health**

- Use **ConfigMaps** or **Secrets** for configuration management.
- Implement **readiness** and **liveness** probes in your deployment manifest.
- Ensure the service gracefully handles restarts and failures.

---

**5. Documentation & Demo**

Include a comprehensive `README.md` with:

- Project overview
- API specification
- Setup instructions (local and Kubernetes)
- Docker build/run instructions
- Kubernetes deployment steps
- Design decisions and rationale

Provide a **demo** in one of the following formats:

- ✅ **Live cluster URL** with sample `curl` commands
- ✅ **Short video (2–3 min)** showing:
    - Docker image build and run
    - Kubernetes deployment
    - API endpoint usage

---

**Deliverables**

- ✅ Git repository (public or private) containing:
    - Go source code
    - Dockerfile
    - Kubernetes YAML manifests
    - README documentation
- ✅ Visual proof:
    - Screencast or live demo
    - Sample API usage

---

**Timeline**

You have **7 calendar days** to complete the challenge. If you need more time or have questions about the task or environment setup, feel free to reach out.

**Evaluation Criteria**

- Code quality and structure
- API design and RESTful principles
- Docker and Kubernetes best practices
- Configuration and health management
- Clarity and completeness of documentation
- Functionality and presentation of the demo
